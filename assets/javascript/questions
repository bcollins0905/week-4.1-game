1)Why set up an object for the stones and not a series of variables?

	What's the difference and when would I know when to do what?




2)return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
};
Where is my understanding flawed?  For the stone, our max is 12 our min is 1 but the function will naturally include zero as a min so we add one. (12 - 0 + 1) = 13

So we are picking a random number up to but not including 13...cool makes sense.  Why do we add another zero at the end then?  Isn't that superfluous?

3)
At this point in the code, I would expect to see a game score of zero in the console and a random number between 19 and 120?  What am I misunderstanding about the use of console log.

	var startGame = function(){

//reset score funtion

gameScore = 0;

//set new target function

targetScore = randomizer(19,120)

console.log(gameScore)
console.log(targetScore)


4)
Is the reason why we don't call a function on the whole stone object because the randomize function would not select a new value for each obj property?  Still trying to come up with a reason as to why we are using an object here rather than a series of variables.  Still can't find a use.

5)
Is there a way to turn this into an each function that iterates over an object like so and assigns new values to each crystal?

"You can use the for-in loop as shown by others. However, you also want to make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype:

for (var key in p) {
  if (p.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(key + " -> " + p[key]);
  }
}"


//set new score for each stone function
stones.green.value = randomizer(1,12)
stones.blue.value = randomizer(1,12)
stones.red.value = randomizer(1,12)
stones.yellow.value = randomizer(1,12)


Again, here I would expect to see what numbers the randomizer has chosen if I console.log(stones or stones.green.value)  I see nothing.  I even tried console.log('Hi')...no luck.  I have asked questions about this and it seems clear and then I go home and try it and it doesn't work.  The answers online seem oversimplified like "did you refresh your browser?"  Yes I did. Any help?
